The approach I took for creating this app is very similar to the previous one. I begin with functionality and build the user experience around it.

I spent many hours researching and trying to figure out how to create a one-to-many relational model but didn't end up making it work yet.

In the future, I would also like to have a "library" of different plants that a user can just click one and it would be added to their personal journal database.

In addition it would be nice to be able to search a database by clicking on a user name displayed on each plant entry and see a list of all the entries that user uploaded into the database.
